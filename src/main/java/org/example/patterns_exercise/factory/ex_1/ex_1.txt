Create an interface Transport with the method deliver().
Implement several classes representing different types of transport (e.g., Truck, Ship, Airplane)
that implement the Transport interface.
Create an interface TransportFactory with the method createTransport().
Implement several factories, each creating a specific type of transport
(e.g., TruckFactory, ShipFactory, AirplaneFactory).
Use these factories to create objects of different transport types in the client code.
The goal of the exercise is to learn how to apply the Factory Method pattern to create
objects of different types based on specific conditions.
