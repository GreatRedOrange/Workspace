Your task is to create several classes for managing a bank account. You should have the following classes:

BankAccount - this class represents a bank account. It should have the following attributes and methods:

accountNumber (account number)
balance (account balance)
owner (account owner)
The deposit(double amount) method, which allows depositing money into the account.
The withdraw(double amount) method, which allows withdrawing money from the account.
Ensure that the balance does not go negative.
The getBalance() method, which returns the current account balance.
Bank - this class represents a bank and manages the accounts. It should have the following attributes and methods:

accounts (a list of bank accounts)
The addAccount(BankAccount account) method, which adds a new bank account to the list of the bank's accounts.
The getAccount(int accountNumber) method, which returns a bank account based on its account number.
The transfer(int fromAccountNumber, int toAccountNumber, double amount) method, which allows transferring money
from one account to another.
Write these classes and test them by creating several bank accounts, performing deposit and withdrawal operations,
and transferring funds between accounts.

Ensure that your classes adhere to the principles of object-oriented programming, such as encapsulation,
inheritance, and polymorphism.
