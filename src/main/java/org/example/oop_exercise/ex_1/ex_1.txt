Create a Shape class that will be an abstract base class for all geometric shapes.
It must have a calculateArea() method,
which will be abstract and must be implemented in subclasses.

Create subclasses for different geometric shapes, such as Circle, Rectangle, and Triangle.
Each of these subclasses must implement the calculateArea() method.
